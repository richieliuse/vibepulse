"""The frames in docs/img must still be frames this firmware renders.

README.md, docs/wifi.md and the release bodies show 480x480 simulator
captures. Nothing checked that they still resemble the panel. They drifted,
and the drift is the invisible kind: the picture stays plausible, so nobody
re-reads it, and a reader ends up trusting a screenshot of a build that no
longer exists.

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. The global Wi-Fi indicator was redrawn in d5be82d
(2026-08-22), which deleted the Font Awesome glyph font
platform/fonts/torget_wifi_22.c and replaced it with the generated
platform/wifi_status_assets.c: a thick bright-white fan became a thin
muted-grey one at a different offset. The two Wi-Fi onboarding frames date
from 1b6ba3a, the day before, so they were stale within twenty-four hours of
being committed. test/test_wifi_setup_wiring.py "pinned" them the whole time
— it asserts they exist, are PNG, are 480x480 and are linked from the README,
and all four stayed true. A picture's dimensions are not its content.

THE RESULT IS BLUNT: of twenty-nine checked-in frames, this guard can verify
FOUR. That is not the guard being weak; it is the guard refusing to call
unverified frames verified, which is what the first three versions of this
file did in three different ways.

PINNED — byte for byte, and that is total. Four frames are reproduced exactly
by a capture --vibepulse-static-qa still produces, so any change to the page
shell, fonts, palette or layout breaks them. The mapping was found by
comparing every frame against every capture, not guessed from filenames.

UNVERIFIED — everything else. Those frames came from ad-hoc simulator states
that no pinned capture set reproduces, so there is no image to compare them
with. Each is quarantined by name AND by a digest of its file. Most are
positively stale: their Wi-Fi indicator is the pre-redraw glyph. The rest
cannot be judged either way, and are quarantined for that reason rather than
waved through — see the next paragraph, which is the whole reason this file
was rewritten.

WHY A BLANK RECTANGLE PROVES NOTHING. The check compares the indicator's own
20x18 box at (426, 28) — the position wifi_status_create() gives it in
platform/torget_ui.c — against the renderings the simulator produces. An
earlier version accepted ANY rendering the QA sets emitted, including a
blank box, and Codex caught what that let through: docs/img/launcher.png has
an all-black box and sailed past, even though every launcher capture draws
the indicator. Blankness is ambiguous by construction — a full-screen
takeover hides the header, and so does a frame captured before the indicator
existed — so it can never be evidence for an unpinned frame.

Worse, and found while checking that: --vibepulse-pulse-qa and
--vibepulse-completion-qa never call torget_wifi_status_set_mode(NORMAL), so
the indicator stays HIDDEN for every capture they write. The SAME tag proves
it — torget-vibepulse-claude-done-static.bmp has 56 indicator pixels under
--vibepulse-static-qa and 0 under --vibepulse-completion-qa. Same surface,
same firmware; the difference is the harness. Feeding those modes into the
allowed set imported blanks that the panel never draws, which is how a
frame's pin could rest on an artifact. This file now reads ONE mode, the one
that exercises the page shell.

THE QUARANTINE, AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY GUARANTEES. STALE_CHROME maps each
unverified frame to a digest of its file, and the test asserts both that the
unverified set is exactly those frames and that each is still the file that
was reviewed. Its first version held filenames only, and Codex was right
that this enforced nothing it advertised: add the new frame's name and
everything passes. Nothing in a repository can stop someone editing a
constant, and claiming otherwise is the mistake AGENTS.md records about a
merge block that was never there. What the digest changes is the price —
a filename AND a 64-character hash a reviewer sees — and it freezes what is
already here: re-capturing a quarantined frame fails, with one correct
answer, delete the entry rather than update the hash.

Deliberately NOT covered: docs/img/mockups/, which are concept art from
tools/mockups/gen_concept_mockups.py and never claimed to be captures, and
docs/img/github/glass-live.png, a photograph of the physical panel.
